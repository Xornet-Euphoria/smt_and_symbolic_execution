# Symbolic Execution

in many directories, there are only solvers and no writeup

- [be_angry](./be_angry/): simple crackme, breakpoint
- [everything_silver](./everything_silver/): z3, no binary (shellcode and trace), triton
- [guardians_of_the_kernel](./guardians_of_the_kernel/): linux kernel module, hook
- [topology](./topology/): hook, CFG, only executing single function (not from main)
- [veritesting](./veritesting/): veritesting

## Todo

- [eldercmp](./eldercmp/): (todo: a little patching and auto-exploration)
- Using Tracer for reverse engineering and exploitation
